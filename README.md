# Scripts

Just some random bash scripts mostly used to test things for my main bash scripts, I put them here to test across my devices.


### Todo

- [ ] Make this into a repo to hold my scripts I regularly used
- [ ] Clean up the random stuff into a new area 
  - New branch? 
  - New folder? 
  - New Repo?
- [ ] Get rid of all the useless stuff
- [ ] Organize into folders and document what to do probably here
